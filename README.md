# Breakup Recovery App

An AI-powered breakup recovery assistant that provides empathetic support, closure templates, a 7-day recovery routine, and a blunt (but constructive) perspective — all generated by dedicated AI agents.  
The app accepts text and optional chat screenshots and returns multi-format support from different agent personalities (Therapist, Closure, Routine Planner, Brutal Honesty).

 **Live Demo:**

## Project Summary

This app orchestrates multiple agent personas (using the `agno` library + Gemini model) to help users cope with breakups:

- **Therapist Agent** — empathetic, validates emotions and offers encouragement.  
- **Closure Agent** — crafts unsent messages, emotional-release exercises, and rituals.  
- **Routine Planner Agent** — builds a 7-day recovery plan with self-care tasks and social detox suggestions.  
- **Brutal Honesty Agent** — objective, actionable feedback to help users move forward.

It supports image uploads (chat screenshots) which are analyzed alongside user text to add contextual understanding.

##�️ Features

- Multi-agent responses with different tones (empathetic, closure, planner, honest).
- Image processing for uploaded screenshots (via `agno.media.Image`).
- Consent-first workflow: the app asks the user to consent before processing content.
- Language adaptability: detects and responds in Hinglish / Hindi if user writes in Hinglish.
- Safe API key handling with Streamlit secrets / environment variables / `.env` fallback.
- Streamlit front-end for quick deployment on Streamlit Cloud (or other hosting).
